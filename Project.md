ðŸš€ Deploying Applications with Helm Charts on Kubernetes ðŸš€

Excited to share my recent project to deploying a web application using Helm charts on Kubernetes! ðŸŽ‰

Here, we created the comics using hashtag#GenerativeAI and make the hashtag#application using hashtag#agile & hashtag#scrum method and deploying it through hashtag#helmcharts in hashtag#kubernetes.

Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.

Charts are created as files laid out in a particular directory tree. They can be packaged into versioned archives to be deployed.
